### Frogger (clone) Game

This is an in-browser game that runs on JavaScript

#### Browser requirements.

Any modern browser should do.

#### To run the game.

Simply open index.html from the root directory in your browser.
You can also, type the complete path into the address bar of your browser.
  i.e. /home/jason/projects/frogger/index.html
  If for some reason, that doesn't work, try preceding the path with 'file://' as follows:
    file:///home/jason/projects/frogger/index.html
